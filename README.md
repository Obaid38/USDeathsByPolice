Fatal Police Shootings Analysis

Overview

This repository analyzes fatal police shootings in the United States from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024, using data compiled by The Washington Post. By integrating US Census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics, this project aims to uncover social trends and potential correlations with the use of fatal force by police officers. The analysis is performed using Python, with visualizations generated to highlight disparities and socioeconomic patterns.

Dataset

Washington Post Fatal Police Shootings Database: A dataset of every fatal shooting by an on-duty police officer in the US since 2015. 

US Census Data: County-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, including poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics. Access via https://data.census.gov.

Requirements

To run the analysis, install the following Python packages:

pip install pandas plotly

Files
app.py: Python script that loads the datasets, merges them, performs analyses (e.g., shootings per 100k people by race, correlations with socioeconomic factors), and generates interactive visualizations using Plotly.
analysis_results.csv: Output file containing the merged dataset and analysis results (generated by app.py).
Run the Analysis:
python app.py
This will generate interactive visualizations and save results to analysis_results.csv.
Analysis
The app.py script performs the following:
Shootings per 100k by Race: Calculates fatal shootings per 100,000 people by race, visualized as a bar plot over time (2015-2024).
Socioeconomic Correlations: Examines relationships between fatal shootings and poverty rate, median household income, and high school graduation rate using scatter plots.
Regional Analysis: Includes a specific analysis of California to highlight racial disparities in fatal shootings.
Visualizations
Bar plot: Fatal shootings per 100k people by race over time.
Scatter plot: Shootings per 100k vs. poverty rate, with median household income as bubble size.
Bar plot: Total fatal shootings in California by race.
Notes
The Washington Post dataset is regularly updated until December 31, 2024. Use the latest version from their GitHub repository.



Census data requires preprocessing to align with the Washington Post dataset (e.g., matching county and state identifiers).



This project addresses a sensitive topic. Interpret results cautiously, considering data limitations and potential biases.
